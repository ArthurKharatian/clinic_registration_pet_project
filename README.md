Deployed on AWS http://54.189.28.84:8080/

The project was performed using a modern stack
including taking into account the international use of the latest versions of the libraries and Spring framework.

The project has 2 branches. 
In the main branch(master) I used technologies and libraries  such as:
Spring Security, CORS, Flyway, PSQL, SLF4J, Lombok, Unit Tests (JUnit + Mockito) for service module testing

In the second branch in addition to the main branch I used technologies and libraries  such as:
H2 Database, SpringBootTest for controller module testing
