# clinic_registration_pet_project

Deployed on AWS http://54.189.28.84:8080/

The project was performed using a modern stack
including taking into account the international use of the latest versions of the libraries and the basic framework.

This makes it easy to customize your application deployment so you can focus on business logic.

A modern implementation of JPA is used, attention is paid to transactionality in working with the database, 
the initialization of the database goes to the opening of the described entities, the built-in ORM platform, 
and the schema may be empty at the start of applications. 

A high degree of coverage with code tests (over 90%), 
tests can be run in the absence of a pre-installed database. Also, results are documenting. 

Checked by SonarLint during development, which allows avoiding frequent flaws in the style and decisions. 

Conciseness was achieved, including thanks to the library Lombok, which eliminates the need to prescribe the accompanying count. 

In the course of the work, the project was hosted on a remote hosting provided by AWS, using Docker, it was built and launched in a container. 

The project has the potential for scalability and further development in the field of professional applications.
